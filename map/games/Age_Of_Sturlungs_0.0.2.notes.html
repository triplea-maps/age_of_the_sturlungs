It may also have been the bloodiest and most violent period  in Icelandic history. It is documented in the Sturlunga saga.<br><br>  This period is marked by the conflicts of powerful chieftains, godar, who amassed followers and did  battle, and is named for the Sturlungs, the most powerful family clan in Iceland at the time. At the end of the era, the Icelandic Commonwealth ceased to exist; Iceland  became a vassal of Norway <br><br>  Historians generally regard the year 1220 as the first year of the Age of the Sturlungs, although some wish to place its beginning at an earlier date because of the  Battle of Vidines.<br> Power in the country had consolidated within the grasp of a few family clans<br><br>       At this time, Haakon The Old  IV of Norway, was trying to extend his influence in Iceland. Many Icelandic chieftains became his vassals and were obliged to do his  bidding -- in exchange they received gifts, followers and a status of respect. Consequently, the greatest Icelandic chieftains were soon affiliated with the King of  Norway in one way or the other.<br>       <br>
